# Google Drive File Upload Instructions

## Issue
You requested to upload files from this Google Drive link to the repository:
**https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hTt8uK7sdA-RvwKRAU5w7O6Ebt2mVqT/view?usp=drivesdk**

Unfortunately, the automated system cannot access Google Drive directly due to security restrictions in the sandboxed environment.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use the Download Script (Recommended for Local Use)

A helper script has been created at `scripts/download_gdrive_files.sh` that you can run on your local machine:

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd /path/to/MGX-repo

# Download files from Google Drive
./scripts/download_gdrive_files.sh "https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hTt8uK7sdA-RvwKRAU5w7O6Ebt2mVqT/view?usp=drivesdk"

# Or use just the file ID
./scripts/download_gdrive_files.sh "11hTt8uK7sdA-RvwKRAU5w7O6Ebt2mVqT"

# Specify a custom output directory
./scripts/download_gdrive_files.sh "11hTt8uK7sdA-RvwKRAU5w7O6Ebt2mVqT" ./data
```

The script will:
1. Install `gdown` if not already installed
2. Download the file from Google Drive
3. Save it to the specified location
4. Provide instructions for committing to git

**Requirements:**
- Python 3 with pip installed
- Internet connection
- The Google Drive file must be publicly accessible (sharing set to "Anyone with the link")

### Option 2: Manual Download and Upload

1. **Download the file from Google Drive:**
   - Open the link in your browser: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hTt8uK7sdA-RvwKRAU5w7O6Ebt2mVqT/view?usp=drivesdk
   - Click the download button
   - Save the file to your local machine

2. **Add to the repository:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the downloaded file to your repository
   cp /path/to/downloaded/file /path/to/MGX-repo/desired/location/
   
   # Add and commit
   cd /path/to/MGX-repo
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add files from Google Drive"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 3: GitHub Web Interface Upload

1. Navigate to https://github.com/moibftj/MGX-repo
2. Click on "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop the downloaded file
4. Commit the changes

### Option 4: Share File Contents Directly

If the file contains code or text:
1. Open the Google Drive file
2. Copy the contents
3. Share them in a GitHub issue or pull request comment
4. I can create the file with those contents

## File Sharing Requirements

For automated downloads to work, ensure your Google Drive file has the correct sharing settings:

1. Open the file in Google Drive
2. Click "Share"
3. Change access from "Restricted" to "Anyone with the link"
4. Set permission to "Viewer" (or higher if needed)
5. Copy the shareable link

## Troubleshooting

### Download Script Fails

If the `download_gdrive_files.sh` script fails:

1. **Check file permissions**: Ensure the Google Drive file is publicly accessible
2. **Verify file ID**: Make sure the file ID `11hTt8uK7sdA-RvwKRAU5w7O6Ebt2mVqT` is correct
3. **Install gdown manually**: `pip install gdown`
4. **Try direct download**: Use gdown directly: `gdown 11hTt8uK7sdA-RvwKRAU5w7O6Ebt2mVqT`

### Large Files

For files larger than 100MB, Google Drive may require additional confirmation. In this case:
- Use the `--fuzzy` flag with gdown: `gdown --fuzzy "URL"`
- Or use Google Drive's desktop client to sync the file
- Or download manually through the web interface

## Next Steps

After successfully adding the files to the repository:

1. Verify the files are present: `git status`
2. Commit if not already done: `git add . && git commit -m "Add files from Google Drive"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
4. Comment on this PR to let me know the files are uploaded
5. I can then help with any integration, modification, or organization needed
